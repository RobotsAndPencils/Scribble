# Annotate Fonts

A Photoshop script that automatically annotates a PSD with the fonts used. Creates a legend with the font name, size (in points, and scaled if designing at 2x) and the hex color code. It ignores layers that are hidden or have 0 opacity. Use it on the current document or a directory.
