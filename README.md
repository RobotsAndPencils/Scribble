# Annotate Fonts

A Photoshop script that automatically annotates your PSDs with font information.

- Lists font names, sizes (in pts) and hex color codes
- Ignores invisible or zero-opacity layers
- Supports @2x designs
- Run on the current document or an entire directory

All annotations are kept in a seperate top-level Font Annotations layer group and no other changes are made to the existing document.
